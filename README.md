# Google Doc Secret Message Decoder

## Overview
This is a simple program written in JS, designed to extract and process data from Google Docs with a known structure. It uses the [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) package to parse the HTML contents, which can then be read and processed.

This program reads the Google Doc contents and decodes a secret message, which is printed to the console using unicode characters.
